1.[Streaming Distributed DNA Sequence Alignment Using Apache Spark](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8251287)

Abstractâ€”The large amount of data generated by NextGeneration Sequencing (NGS) technology, usually in the order
of hundreds of gigabytes per experiment, has to be analyzed
quickly to generate meaningful variant results. The first step
in analyzing such data is to map those sequenced reads to
their corresponding positions in the human genome. One of
the most popular tools to do such sequence alignment is the
Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA mem). One limitation of the
BWA program though is that it cannot be run on a cluster.
In this paper, we propose StreamBWA, a new framework
that allows the BWA mem program to run on a cluster in
a distributed fashion, at the same time while the input data
is being streamed into the cluster. It can process the input
data directly from a compressed file, which either lies on the
local file system or on a URL. Moreover, StreamBWA can start
combining the output files of the distributed BWA mem tasks
at the same time while these tasks are still being executed
on the cluster. Empirical evaluation shows that this streaming
distributed approach is approximately 2x faster than the nonstreaming approach. Furthermore, our streaming distributed
approach is 5x faster than other state-of-the-art solutions such
as SparkBWA. The source code of StreamBWA is publicly
available at https://github.com/HamidMushtaq/StreamBWA
